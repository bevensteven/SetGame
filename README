The set_challenge.py file holds the main class that computes our desired output and it depends on utils.py.

A brief test function is used in test_set.py and requires:
input/1
input/2
input/3
input/4

Otherwise, comment out lines 10-37. 

test_set.py is ran with an input file in the format of the input in the instructions and writes to an output file 'output/_out' in the format specified in the instructions. I've also assumed per the instructions that inputs will be given in a valid form.

# python test_set.py <input_file>

output file after running the command above = output/_out
